# Dota 2 Matches Tracker
This program scrapes data from [DOTABUFF](https://www.dotabuff.com/) and [TrackDota](https://www.trackdota.com/) to get the match's result or the match's activity log

## Requirements
* Python 3
* Requests
* Google Chrome
* BeautifulSoup
* Selenium
* ChromeDriver

## Notes
* Here I'm using Chrome version 99, so the ChromeDriver file is version 99.0.4844.51
* Since TrackDota does not allow web scraping, I have to remove the code.
